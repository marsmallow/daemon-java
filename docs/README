    Java Daemon Application

This is a simple Java application that will run on Unix/Linux operating systems
as a daemon using the Apache Commons Daemon. The purpose of this application is
to serve as a template/example of how to set up a Java application as a daemon
on Unix/linux systems and as an example of how to use jsvc.

The java_daemon_init script can be copied to /etc/init.d/ and used in the normal
{start|stop|restart} manner.
